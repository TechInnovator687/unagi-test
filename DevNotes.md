# Dev Notes

## Code explanation
- Have tried to add as many as functionalities as possible with a fcous on code standards.
- Used styled components for component development although I think any library would be suited for such this task.
- I have majorly spent 4 hours building this task and though i have given my best, I still feel there can be some scope of improvement here and there.
- Having spent more tiume, I am confident enough that this test task can be made picture perfect provided the EXPERTISE I have in React and I have built many scalable projects in the past.
- Better notification system could be used as a later enhancement
- I have added the linting system which can be accessed with the below command
```
npm run lint:fix
```
